Development plan:

1: get system generation working
x    generate coordinates (figure out weighting)
x    generate star(s)
x        generate planets
s            generate moon(s)
s        generate station(s)
s        generate asteroid belt(s)
    
2: generate a galaxy and save it to a file
x    generate systems
s    generate dust and gas clouds

3: get visualization working
    plotly
    plot individual system 
        2d map(?) with orbits, belts, planets, stations
        color code planets
        inset for gas giant moons
     plot galaxy
        interactive 3d? (plotly somehow?)
            hover text indicates name and planets?
            select two systems find travel time
        2d top down
            hover text
        

4: implement into GUI (pysimplegui?)
    gui for generation
    separate one for vis? or separate tab(s)

5: customization
    ability to add in custom systems or other elements
